# ledger-settlement (Spring Boot service)

Persists Ledger payments in PostgreSQL and serves two endpoints: record a payment, and
report what a merchant is owed. Built to replace the in-memory store that lost an
evening of MR-4471's records on a restart on 4 March 2026.

## Stack

- Java 25
- Spring Boot 4.1.1 (`spring-boot-starter-parent`, so every starter's own version comes
  from that one BOM rather than being pinned separately)
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Bean Validation, PostgreSQL driver, Flyway
- Testcontainers (`spring-boot-testcontainers`, `testcontainers-bom:1.20.4`) for the
  integration test

## The settlement rule

`ledger.fee-rate: 0.031` in `application.yml` is converted **once**, at
`SettlementService` construction, from a `BigDecimal` to an exact `long` count of basis
points (310) — never multiplied against money as a `double`. Every calculation after that
point is `long` arithmetic: `fee = gross * 310 / 10_000`. For the lab's reference payment:

```
gross 128450 -> fee 3981 -> net 124469
```

That is the same rounding discipline every earlier lab in this module enforced in plain
Java, now carried through a Spring `@ConfigurationProperties` binding without ever
touching a `double`.

## Why PaymentEntity is a class, not a record

Hibernate instantiates a managed entity through a no-argument constructor and populates
its fields by reflection afterward — there is no constructor call to pass values through,
so a record's single, final, all-args canonical constructor cannot satisfy that protocol.
Full reasoning is in the class's own javadoc.

## Run it

Requires Docker (for Testcontainers) and access to Maven Central. **Neither was available
in the sandbox this project was prepared in** — see the "Build and run status" section of
research.md for exactly what was and was not verified, and do not skip it before marking.

```
mvn clean verify
```

`PaymentControllerIT` starts a real `postgres:17-alpine` container via Testcontainers,
posts 128,450 minor units GBP for MR-4471, and asserts the settlement comes back at
124,469 minor units — plus four more tests covering negative amounts, a blank
merchantId, an unknown merchant, and the GET /payments/{id} endpoint added for the Agent
Review step.

**Final surefire/failsafe summary line:**

Left as an honest placeholder, for the same reason as lab sjv-l0-3's README: this
submission does not include a build output it did not actually produce.

## Manual smoke test

```bash
docker run -d --name ledger-pg -e POSTGRES_DB=ledger -e POSTGRES_USER=ledger \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ledger -p 5432:5432 postgres:17-alpine

export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ledger
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=ledger
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=ledger
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then run the five curl commands in `endpoint-log.md`.
